## My last week

I had a wonderful time last week doing lots of tasks and work. This included lab work, programming, and creating reports, presentations, and papers. In addition, I was able to relax this weekend outside in the nice weather.

I think I spent last week productive and useful because I completed all my assignments and work on time and spent my free time with my favorite people and activities.
