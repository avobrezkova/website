## My last week

I'm glad you decided to read my first post. I’ll start by saying that everyone means different things by “productive. I will tell you how I spent last week. It started, of course, with lectures and seminars, and I’ve been going over the Files and presentations on the different courses. 

For the first few days of training, I did 2 labs that had to be handed in at the end of the week. Thanks to the fact that I did everything at the beginning of the week, on the night of Thursday to Friday, I was able to go with my friends and congratulate my friend on her nineteenth birthday. Despite the fact that on Friday I had to get up at 7 and go to the university to the first couple for a calculus test. The next day, on Saturday, with the same company, we went to a festive breakfast in a beautiful restaurant, where we celebrated Lizin's birthday, but we won't tell what happened in the evening. :)
